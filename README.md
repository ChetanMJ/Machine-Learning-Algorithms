# 10601 - Machine-Learning 

Below are the machine learning algorithms implemented as part of the Machine Learning course 10601:

## Decison Trees
Decision Tree classifier and apply it to several binary classification problems. This assignment consists of several parts: In Section 1, work through some Information Theory basics in order to “learn” a Decision Tree on paper. Then in Section 2, implement Decision Tree learning, prediction, and evaluation.

## Logistic Regression and Stochastic Gradient descent
sentiment polarity analyzer, which will be capable of analyzing the overall sentiment polarity (positive or negative) . In Section 1 you will warm up by deriving stochastic gradient descent updates for multinomial logistic regression. Then in Section 2 you will implement a binary logistic regression model as the core of your natural language processing system

## Neural Networks and Back Propogation
Build a handwriting recognition system using a neural network. As a warmup, Section 1 will lead you through an on-paper example of how to implement a neural network.
Then, in Section 2, you will implement an end-to-end system that learns to perform handwritten letter classification.

## Hidden Markov Model
implement a new named entity recognition system using Hidden Markov Models.

## Reinforcement Learning
implement a reinforcement learning algorithm for solving the classic mountain-car environment. Section 1 will lead you through an on-paper example of how value iteration and Q-learning work. Then, in Section 2, you will implement Q-learning with function approximation to solve the mountain car environment.
